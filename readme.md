# Budget Tracker

[Demo] (https://boiling-everglades-05608.herokuapp.com/)

Repurposed existing Budget Tracker to add offline functionality and access.

The user can add deposits and expenses to the tracker while connected or not connected to the internet.  All transactions made while offline will be maintained when the user is back online.

## User Story
AS an traveller
I WANT to be able to track my withdrawals and deposits with or without a data/internet connection
SO THAT my account balance is accurate when I am traveling

## Business Context
Giving users a fast and easy way to track their money is important, but allowing them to access that information anytime is even more important. Having offline functionality is paramount to our applications success.
